```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Load and Preprocess the data:
```{r results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars, n=3)
dim(mtcars)
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtcars$vs <- as.factor(mtcars$vs)
mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am)
mtcars$gear <- factor(mtcars$gear)
mtcars$carb <- factor(mtcars$carb)
attach(mtcars)
```

#### Exploratory Analysis
**See Appendix Figure I** Exploratory Box graph that compares Automatic and Manual 
transmission MPG. From the graph we can infer that there is a significant
increase in MPG when for vehicles with a manual transmission vs automatic.

##### Statistical Inference
T-Test transmission type and MPG
```{r}

tResults <- t.test(mpg ~ am)
tResults$p.value

```

The T-Test rejects the null hypothesis that the difference between transmission types is 0.

```{r}
tResults$estimate
```

The difference estimate between the 2 transmissions is 7.24494 MPG which is similar to whats there in the manual.

##### Regression Analysis
Fit the full model of the data
```{r results='hide'}

fullModelFit <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)
summary(fullModelFit)  # results hidden
summary(fullModelFit)$coeff  # results hidden

```
Since none of the coefficients have a p-value less than 0.05 we cannot conclude which variables are more statistically significant. 

Backward selection to determine which variables are most statistically 
significant
```{r results='hide'}

stepFit <- step(fullModelFit)
summary(stepFit) # results hidden
summary(stepFit)$coeff # results hidden

```

The new model has 4 variables, namely cylinders, horsepower, weight and transmission. The R-squared value of 0.8659 confirms that this model explains about 87% of the variance in MPG. The p-values also are statistically significantly because they have a p-value less than 0.05. The coefficients conclude that increasing the number of cylinders from 4 to 6 with decrease the MPG by 3.03.Further increasing the cylinders to 8 with decrease the MPG by 2.16.  Increasing the horsepower is decreases MPG 3.21 for every 100 horsepower.  Weight decreases the MPG by 2.5 for each 1000 lbs increase. A Manual transmission improves the MPG by 1.81.

#### Residuals & Diagnostics
Residual Plot
**See Appendix Figure II**

The plots conclude:

1. The randomness of the Residuals vs. Fitted plot supports the assumption of independence
2. The points of the Normal Q-Q plot following closely to the line conclude that the distribution of residuals is normal
3. The Scale-Location plot random distribution confirms the constant variance assumption
4. Since all points are within the 0.05 lines, the Residuals vs. Leverage 
concludes that there are no outliers

```{r}

sum((abs(dfbetas(stepFit)))>1)

```

#### Conclusion
There is a difference in MPG based on transmission type. A manual transmission will have a slight MPG boost. However, it seems that weight, horsepower, & number of cylinders are more statistically significant when determining MPG.
